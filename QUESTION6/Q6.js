// Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the 
// name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the 
// whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
console.log("HELLO!MY FRIENDS");
console.log("HELLO\tMY\tFRIENDS");
console.log("HELLO\nMY\nFRIENDS");
